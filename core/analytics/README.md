# Analytics

This module is currently a no-op module as we do not have requirements for analytics.

The idea behind this module is to encapsulate and host all of the logic for any analytics
needed in the app. Right now this module does not have an api as there is nothing to 
encapsulate but in the future analytics batching or other bits of logic may be added which
we could prevent exposure of with an api sub module. 

As of now we expose analytics 
preemptively (something I wouldnt actually do but just tryna prove a point here)
